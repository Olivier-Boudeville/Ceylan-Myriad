% Header to export gui-related defines.
%
% See gui.erl for the corresponding implementation.



% For WxWindows defines:
-include_lib("wx/include/wx.hrl").


-define( any_id, ?wxID_ANY ).

-define( no_parent, wx:null() ).


% The special color that means "transparent" (i.e. no filling):
-define( transparent_color, ?wxTRANSPARENT_BRUSH ).



% Rewriting of '-record(wx,' could have been, with maybe a better naming:
%
%-record( gui_event, {
%
%		   id :: id(),
%		   event_source :: gui_object(),
%		   user_data :: user_data(),
%		   event_type :: event_type()
%
%}).
%
%-type gui_event() :: #gui_event{}.
%
% Anyway we receive messages as wx records, and cannot change that easily.
