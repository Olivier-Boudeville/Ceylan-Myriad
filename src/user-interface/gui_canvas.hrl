% Header to export canvas-related defines.
%
% See canvas.erl for the corresponding implementation.



% wxCanvas does not exist, we emulate it.
%
% Canvas are back-buffered: drawing operations on it will not be visible until
% the blit/1 function is called on it.
%
-record( canvas, {

		   panel       :: gui:panel(),
		   bitmap      :: gui:bitmap(),
		   back_buffer :: gui:back_buffer()

}).


% The actual canvas type we are to use:
-type canvas() :: #canvas{}.


% An OpenGL-based canvas:
-type gl_canvas():: wxGLCanvas:wxGLCanvas().
