% Gathering of various facilities for linear operations.
%
-module(linear).


% These type names are too general to be defined in the hrl file (i.e. in the
% root namespace).


% Cartesian coordinates in a referential:
%
-type coordinate() :: number().


% Cartesian integer coordinates in a referential:
%
-type integer_coordinate() :: integer().




% Distance between two points:
%
-type distance() :: number().


% Mostly for clarity:
%
-type radius() :: distance().



% Integer distance between two points (ex: to express lengths):
%
-type integer_distance() :: integer().


% Square of a distance between two points (cheaper to compute, when applying the
% square root operator is not needed, like when comparing distances):
%
-type square_distance() :: number().



% Area of a surface:
%
-type area() :: float().


-export_type([ coordinate/0, integer_coordinate/0,
			   distance/0, radius/0, integer_distance/0, square_distance/0,
			   area/0 ]).
