-module(transform4).

-moduledoc """
Module implementing the support for **4x4 transformations** (hence for
3D computations), based on pairs (in logical terms - these are actually
records) made of an homogeneous matrix and its inverse, which are updated and
maintained through the operations applied to them.

The operations triggered on a transformation (the said matrix pair) are the
same (name, arguments and their order, contract) that would be triggered
directly on its reference matrix only.

So, instead of a matrix M, a transformation can be seen (logically) as a
{M,InvM} pair, and instead of applying for example an operation O (whose
matrix is Mo) on M with M' = M.Mo, we have here T' = T.Mo = {M.Mo,
InvMo.InvM}.

See also `matrix4.erl`, as this module offers a larger subset of its API (with
any "homogeneous" removed in the function names, as it is implicit here). For
non-covered functions, just get/set the reference/inverse matrices that a
transform4 contains.
""".



% Implementation notes:
%
% Requiring the inverse of an invertible logical transformation happens
% frequently, so our actual transformations are a pair of matrices: a given
% reference matrix and its precomputed inverse; they are both to be updated
% based on each operation applied: the reference by this actual operation and
% the other by its reciprocal (inverse operation applied on the other side), so
% that either remains directly available with no further computation (and that
% of course they remains inverse matrices).
%
% Said differently, thanks to these reciprocal updates, the inverse of a logical
% transformation is always readily available, while never being explicitly
% computed from scratch (which would be expected to be costlier).
%
% If such operations may not be invertible or even linear, we consider here that
% these are actually 3D operations represented thanks to 4D homogeneous matrices
% that may be invertible (e.g. for translations).
%
% The various types of matrix4 (canonical, compact, identity) are transparently
% managed.
%
% We suppose that storing only homogeneous_matrix4 instances (not matrix4
% instances) is sufficient for all uses.
%
% Inverse transformations are needed in many cases, especially when dealing with
% scene graphs (refer to the reference_tree module): if, to compute a transition
% matrix from a reference frame R1 to another R2, only the reference matrices
% from R1 to the closest parent of R1 and R2 are needed, conversely, from this
% parent to R2, we require this time the inverse matrices; these shall thus be
% directly available as well.


% Understanding the role and composition of transformations.
%
% A transformation (e.g. T12) conveys how elements expressed in a coordinate
% system R1 can be expressed in a coordinate system R2, and vice versa: thanks
% to its pair of reference (RefM) / inverse (InvM) matrices, a transformation
% provides a two-way conversion between frames of reference:
%
% - by our conventions, the reference matrix is the transition matrix from R1 to
% R2: a vector expressed in R1 as V1 will be expressed in R2 as V2 = RefM.V1
%
% - conversely, the inverse matrix takes in charge the transition from R2 to
% R1: a vector expressed in R2 as V2 will be expressed in R1 as V1 = InvM.V2.
%
% For example let's suppose that we are in a R1 reference frame, defined
% relatively to another reference frame R2 (noted R1->R2: R1 depends on R2, R1
% being typically represented as a child of R2, hence lower than R2 in the
% reference tree) by a translation of 5 along its X axis (R1 can thus be seen as
% the translated system here). Let's suppose that we have 3D content defined in
% R1, but we need to have them in R2; we are thus interested here in T12 (whence
% of course its inverse T21 can be easily obtained).
%
% Then T12=transform4:translation(_VT=[5,0,0]) will correspond to a
% transformation whose reference matrix RefM is the identity_4 matrix except for
% its top-right element, equal to +5. Applying (on the right) to RefM a vector
% of R1 V1=[X,Y,Z] will indeed result in a vector of R2, V2 = RefM.V1 =
% [X+5,Y,Z].
%
%
% Regarding composition, transformations can be chained by multiplying them on
% the right, based on a parent-to-child order.
%
% For example, if R3 is a base coordinate system, R2 is defined relatively to
% R3, and R1 relatively to R2 (noted R1->R2->R3), and if the T12 and T23
% transformations have been defined like explained just above, then a vector
% expressed in R1 as V1 will be expressed in R3 as V3 = T23_RefM.T12_RefM.V1.
% Conversely, V1 = T21_InvM.T32_InvM.V3 (as (Ma.Mb)^-1 = Mb^-1.Ma^-1).

% Usual transformations.
%
% 3D models (e.g. one of a type of spaceship) are generally defined centered in
% a local coordinate system Rl of their own (as a geometry, which may be common
% to multiple instances), whereas each model instance (a specific, actual
% spaceship) has its own geometrical information (e.g. positioning) computed. So
% a given spaceship may be known to be at a given point, pointing to a given
% direction, and being potentially scaled (defining its own frame of reference)
% - all that relatively to, ultimately, some more global frame of reference Rg
% (e.g. some galactic center).
%
% To place correctly such a model in Rg in one go, a suitable transformation may
% be devised. To convert the coordinates of a point (e.g. the tip of the
% cockpit) Pl in Rl to the ones (Pg) of that point in Rg, we can define the Tlg
% transformation, whose reference matrix RefM=Pl->g allows to determine Pg =
% RefM.Pl.
%
% For that, Tlg.RefM = Pl->g = TrM.RotM.SclM is the transition matrix from l to
% g, where SclM applies the scaling (as determined by three scaling factors
% along the axes of Rl), RotM the rotation (as determined by a unit axis and an
% angle; the corresponding matrix has for columns the axes of Rl expressed in
% Rg) and TrM the translation (as determined by Ol/g, i.e. a vector of Rg
% pointing to the origin of Rl).
%
% This is the recommended order of the operations, otherwise these
% transformations would become coupled and would interfere negatively (e.g. a
% translation vector would be scaled as well).
%
% To help reasoning about coordinate systems, juste consider a base, parent R2
% one, and a child, R1 one, just translated of [+5,0,0]; conversions of
% coordinates are then just a matter of carefully adding or subtracting 5.
%
% To parameter a transformation T12, elements (vectors, angles, etc.) can be
% defined either in R1 or R2. Although using as reference R1 could seem more
% logical, knowing that generally R1->R2, we prefer defining transformations in
% R2, i.e. in the parent (rather than in the child).
%
% More precisely, for each transformation T12 we have (A) to define it from
% parameters and (B) to use it (hence there are two different steps to manage,
% possibly with different needs/conventions). Let's suppose that, following our
% conventions, R1->R2 (e.g. R1 is attached to a spaceship and R2 is absolute; so
% we typically have R2 and wants to define R1 relatively to it) and that we
% consider a point P whose coordinates in R1 are P1, and in R2 are P2.
%
% In general terms, if for a given operation we start from R2 to derive R1, then
% to convert points in R1 to point in R2 we have to apply the opposite
% operation.
%
%
% For a translation:
%
%  - A: T12 is typically used to specify/support R1, and this transformation can
%  be defined only with respect to R2; so the translation vector VT used to
%  create this transformation should correspond to the coordinates of the origin
%  of R1 (child) expressed in R2 (parent)
%
%  - B: P2 = P1->2.P1 = RefM.P1, and also P2 = P1+VT
%
% So for a translation, RefM simply has to include VT as expressed in R2
% (e.g. not -VT / not VT expressed in R1) in its rightmost column; another view
% on this is that we defined R1 from R2 by adding VT'=-VT to convert coordinates
% from R2 to R1, and thus P1->2 should subtract VT' from coordinates of R1 -
% thus adding VT.
%
%
% For a rotation:
%
%  - A: T12 is typically used to specify/support R1, and this transformation can
%  be defined only with respect to R2; so the rotation vector (and angle) should
%  be considered in R2: R1 is obtained from R2 by rotating of an angle alpha
%  around a unit vector V2 defined in R2
%
%  - B: P2 = P1->2.P1 = RefM.P1, and also P2 = Rot(V2,-alpha)
%
% So for a rotation, RefM simply corresponds to the rotation of the opposite
% angle.
%
%
% For a scaling:
%
% We ultimately want that all distances along a given axis (say X) get
% multiplied at step B by a factor f: P2 = {X2,Y2,Z2} = {f.X1,Y1,Z1}; as P2 =
% P1->2.P1 = RefM.P1, P1->2 just has to use directly the expected scaling
% factors (e.g. not their inverse).
%
% Note that the system in which some vectors above are defined is somewhat
% implicit (e.g. is the rotation axis defined in source or target system? Does
% the scaling happens along the source axes or the target ones?). Its depends on
% the "current" system when these operations are applied, i.e. of the operation
% order (see TrM.RotM.SclM above).
%
% Note also that a transformation can be seen as an action (e.g. scale the
% coordinates of that matrix) or a transition between coordinate systems. For
% example, a scaling transformation of a uniform factor S can also be
% interpreted to be a transition to a coordinate system whose axes are scaled of
% a factor 1/S.
%
% Care must also be taken with scalings, as their transformation do not involve
% orthonormal matrices anymore, losing some properties (e.g. inverse of an
% orthonormal matrix being its transpose).


% For records like matrix4:
-include("matrix4.hrl").

% For the #transform4 record:
-include("transform4.hrl").

We tend to prefer (by convention) "upward" transformations in a reference tree,
