- helpers for graphical user interface (GUI) programming
- all-purpose helper scripts

In future versions of this document, following topics will be discussed:

- HDF5 support
- REST support
- third-party language bindings (ex: Python, Java, maybe in the future Haskell)

Even if this is not an exhaustive walk-through, each of them is detailed in turn below.

The next level of detail is to peer at the referenced source files, as they include many implementation notes, comments and typing information.
