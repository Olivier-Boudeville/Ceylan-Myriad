``Myriad`` Main Conventions
===========================

- for clarity, we tend to use longer variable names, in CamelCase
- we tend to use mute variables to clarify meanings and intents, as in ``_Acc=[]`` (beware, despite being muted, any variable in scope that bears the same name will be matched)
- as there is much list-based recursion, a variable named ``T`` means ``Tail`` (as in ``[Head|Tail]``)
