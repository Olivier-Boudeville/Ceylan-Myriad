% This is a configuration file of rebar3, so that Ceylan-Myriad can better
% integrate in the current OTP ecosystem, despite its (more complex, probably
% more flexible) native build based on GNU make.
%
% If the name of this file is 'rebar.config', then it is a generated file,
% otherwise it is a template (in conf/rebar.config.template), meant to be filled
% by information coming from GNUmakevars.inc.
%
% The previous version of this file used a compile pre-hook (triggering the
% 'rebar3-compile' make target), however having BEAM files that were more recent
% than their sources was not sufficient to prevent rebar from attempting to
% recompile them (and fail).

% As the option of writing a custom rebar compile module and/or plugin is not so
% relevant (long, complicated and risky), we also tried with no luck the
% generation of a separate, fake, non-nested, OTP-standard layout (see the
% 'create-fake-otp-project' make target), however rebar was still attempting to
% perform extraneous, failing recompilations.

% Finally we created from scratch a direct rebar structure with 'rebar3 new lib
% myriad' and filled by hand the resulting rebar.config until it became
% satisfactory; then we automated (at least most of) its generation from Make.


% Base layout obtained thanks to: 'rebar3 new lib myriad', as Myriad is a
% library OTP application (without supervision trees), and to be taken into
% account, from the library root, through 'make rebar3-application' or 'make
% rebar3-release'.
