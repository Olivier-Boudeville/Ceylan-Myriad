% This is the configuration file of rebar3, so that Myriad can better integrate
% in the current OTP ecosystem, despite its (more complex) build based on GNU make.

% Base layout was obtained thanks to: 'rebar3 new lib myriad', as Myriad is a
% library OTP application (without supervision trees).

% To be run as: 'rebar3 compile' from the library root.


% No dependency (expect Erlang of course):
{deps, []}.

% We need to rely on our dedicated build procedure (ex: for the parse transforms
% involved):
%
{pre_hooks, [ {compile, "make rebar3-compile"} ]}.

%{post_hooks, [
%	{compile, "echo 'Myriad post compile hook!'"} ]}.
