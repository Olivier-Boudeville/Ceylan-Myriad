% Header to export **MyriadGUI-related base defines and records**, both for user
% code and for internal one.
%
% See gui.hrl for the overall, single user-facing MyriadGUI include.



% Registration name of the MyriadGUI environment process:
-define( gui_env_reg_name, 'myriad_gui_env' ).


% Registration name of the MyriadGUI identifier allocator process (see gui_id):
-define( gui_id_alloc_reg_name, 'myriad_gui_id_allocator' ).

% Registration name of the MyriadGUI main event loop:
-define( gui_event_loop_reg_name, 'myriad_gui_event_loop' ).


% Context sent to corresponding subscribers together with an event.
%
% This context can be ignored in most cases.
%
-record( event_context, {

	% The (lower-level, backend-specific) identifier of the event source
	% (generally not useful, as the top-level gui_object() and any
	% gui_id:name_id() shall be enough):
	%
	id :: gui_id:backend_id(),


	% Usually of no use, as such user data is a means of preserving a state,
	% whereas the user event loop is often a better solution to do so:
	%
	user_data = [] :: gui:user_data(),


	% The full (verbatim), lower-level (backend) event (if any) resulting in our
	% event.
	%
	% (useful for example when deciding to propagate it upward in the widget
	% hierarchy)
	%
	backend_event = undefined :: option( gui:backend_event() ) } ).
