% Like the Erlang shell:
-define( default_command_history_max_depth, 20 ).
-define( default_result_history_max_depth, 20 ).

% Thus a reserved (non-muted) name:
-define( shell_state_binding_name, "_MyriadBindingForShellState" ).


% The state of a Myriad (custom) shell instance.
-record( shell_state, {

    % The number of commands already submitted; corresponds to the number
    % (identifier) of any last command (or the one of the next command, minus
    % 1):
    %
    submission_count = 0 :: basic_utils:count(),

    % Tells whether the start of commands shall be timestamped:
    do_timestamp = false :: boolean(),


    % Tells whether the full history (inputs and outputs) shall be logged on
    % file and, if yes, in which one:
    %
    log_path = undefined :: option( file_utils:bin_file_path() ),

    % The file (if any) where logs are to be written:
    log_file = undefined :: option( file_utils:file() ),


    % Maximum number of command history elements (0: none; 1: just the last one,
    % etc.; undefined: infinite):
    %
    cmd_history_max_depth=?default_command_history_max_depth ::
        option( basic_utils:count() ),

    % Maximum number of result history elements (0: none; 1: just the last one,
    % etc.; undefined: infinite):
    %
    res_history_max_depth=?default_result_history_max_depth ::
        option( basic_utils:count() ),


    % Possibly ellipsed:
    cmd_history :: shell_utils:command_history(),

    % Possibly ellipsed:
    res_history :: shell_utils:result_history(),

    % Any file for persistent storage of past commands:
    cmd_history_file :: option( file_utils:file() ),


    % Records all current bindings:
    bindings :: erl_eval:binding_struct(),


    % The name of the module used by this shell in order to locate its built-in
    % functions:
    %
    % (made to be overridden with special-purpose modules, potentially using
    % this one as for default implementations)
    %
    callback_module='shell_default_callbacks' :: meta_utils:module_name(),

    % Any module (e.g. 'gui_shell') of reference, for example from which help
    % information can be obtained.
    %
    reference_module :: option( meta_utils:module_name() ),


    % The function that shall be called when there is a call to a local function
    % in a shell command.
    %
    local_fun_handler :: erl_eval:local_function_handler()


    % At least currently, a shell does not keep track of the process(es) using
    % it.
