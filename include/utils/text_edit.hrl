% The state of a general-purpose text edition facility.
%
% Note that at least most users of text edits shall rely on the functions of the
% text_edit module, rather than including and using this record.

-record( text_edit, {

	% Identifier (number) of the entry being currently edited (hence that will
	% be the "next" one).
	%
	% So corresponds to the number of entries already submitted (as obtained
	% from the corresponding processor) plus one.
	%
	entry_id :: text_edit:entry_id(),

	% Any text before the leftmost position of the cursor:
	prefix :: text_utils:ustring(),

	% The number of characters of the prefix:
	prefix_len :: text_utils:length(),

	% The characters (Unicode codepoints) that are strictly before the current
	% cursor, in reverse order:
	%
	precursor_chars = [] :: [ text_utils:uchar() ],

	% The characters (Unicode codepoints) that are at or after the current
	% cursor (in normal order):
	%
	postcursor_chars = [] :: [ text_utils:uchar() ],


	% Tells whether a trailing dot should be automatically added if lacking in a
	% entry (mostly useful for shells; default: false):
	%
	auto_add_trailing_dot = false :: boolean(),

	% Tells whether the entry cursor should wrap around:
	wrap_cursor = false :: boolean(),


	% The identifier of any entry currently selected in their history:
	hist_entry_id :: option( text_edit:entry_id() ),

	% To backup the currently-edited entry while navigating in their history:
	current_entry :: option( text_edit:entry() ),

	% The PID of the underlying actual processing logic:
	processor_pid :: text_edit:processor_pid() } ).
