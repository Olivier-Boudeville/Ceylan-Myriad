% For root_ref_id:
-include("reference_tree.hrl").


% A 3D frame of reference, defining notably a coordinate system.
%
% Such frame belongs to a (3D) reference tree, which holds notably an
% associative table of reference frames, based on their identifier.
%
% A shorthand for this record and corresponding type is "ref3".
%
% A parent frame of reference is either explicitly defined (note that it relies
% then on an implicit reference table) or, if not defined, is the global, root,
% absolute one.
%
-record( reference_frame3, {

	% The name (if any) of a reference frame (this is not an identifier).
	name :: option( reference_frame:ref_name() ),


	% The parent reference frame of this one, to be found in an (implicit)
	% reference table.
	%
	% Any reference frame not having a parent specifically defined (which is the
	% default for this record) is considered to be absolutely defined, i.e. it
	% is then defined relative to the root node - as opposed to one having a
	% parent specified, to which it is then relative.
	%
	% Only the root of a reference tree as a parent set to 'undefined'.
	%
	parent = ?root_ref_id :: option( reference_tree:ref_id() ),


	% A list of the (direct) children of this reference frame:
	% (cached precomputation deduced from the parent information)
	%
	children = [] :: reference_tree:child_ids(),


	% An (optional) identifier path from the (implicit) root frame of reference
	% to this frame (cached precomputation)
	%
	path_from_root :: option( reference_tree:id_path() ),


	% The 3D transformation (based on 4x4 matrices) between the parent reference
	% frame (if any, otherwise from the root, absolute reference frame) and this
	% one.
	%
	% The reference matrix held by this transformation is the transition matrix
	% from to this reference frame to its parent (if any, otherwise to the
	% global reference frame).
	%
	% Its associated inverse matrix is therefore the transition matrix from the
	% parent reference frame (if any, otherwise from the root, absolute
	% reference frame) to this frame of reference.
