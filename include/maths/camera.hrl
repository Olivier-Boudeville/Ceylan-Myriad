	% The origin of the viewpoint corresponding to this camera, in world space:

	% the camera whereas pointing at the same target)

	target :: point3:point3(),


	% The actual direction at which this camera points, in world space, from its
	% position to its target, as a unit vector computed by look_at/3 (thus a
	% value to be read, not set).
	%
	% (this direction will thus correspond to the -Z axis of the local
	% coordinate system of this camera)
	%
	aim :: vector3:unit_vector3(),


	% The direction, in world space, of the upper part of this camera, as a unit
	% vector computed by look_at/3 (thus a value to be read, not set).
	%
	% (this direction will thus correspond to the +Y axis of the local
	% coordinate system of this camera)
	%

	% The direction, in world space, of the leftmost part of this camera, as a
	% unit vector computed by look_at/3 (thus a value to be read, not set).

	% (this direction will thus correspond to the +X axis of the local

	% The view transformation, based on the current camera settings, between its
	% coordinate system and another one - generally the world one.
	%
	% More precisely, its reference matrix4 is Pcw, the transition one from
	% camera to world, and Pwc, its inverse - generally the most useful one - is
	% the transition matrix4 from world to camera space.
	%
	% As a consequence, any change in the previous camera fields should result
	% in invalidating this one (i.e. setting it to 'undefined'), so that it gets
	% recomputed whenever needed (refer to look_at/3 for that).
