% As, sometimes, defines in header files make sense:
-ifndef(myriad_maths_reference_tree_hrl_guard).
-define(myriad_maths_reference_tree_hrl_guard,).


-define( root_ref_id, 0 ).
% The identifier of the root, absolute reference frame.
%
% Note that this information is in some sense redundant with the fact that we
% expect that a single node (the root one) has no parent.


% A reference tree, also known as a scene graph.
%
% Note that the root, absolute reference frame is to be designated by the null
% (zero) reference frame identifier (see the root_ref_id define).

-record( reference_tree, {

    % The main table of this tree, concentrating all known reference frames,
    % based on their identifier.
    %
    ref_table :: reference_tree:ref_table(),

    % A table caching the computed paths from on frame to another:
    path_table :: reference_tree:path_table(),

    % The identifier to be allocated at the next registered frame:
    next_ref_id = ?root_ref_id + 1 :: reference_tree:ref_id() } ).
