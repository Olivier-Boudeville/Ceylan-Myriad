-record( mesh, {

	% The points defining that mesh, as a repository thereof:
	vertices :: mesh:vertex_repository(), 

	% The types of the faces from which this mesh is made (e.g. triangle, quad):
	face_type :: mesh:face_type(),


	% The faces defining that mesh, based on the indices of vertices:
	%
	% (all faces of a mesh are expected to have the same number of vertices)
	%
	faces = [] :: [ mesh:indexed_face() ],


	% To which geometric element (e.g. per vertex, per face) the next normals
	% (if any) correspond:
	%
	normal_type :: mesh:normal_type(),

	% The (unit) normals (if any) of that mesh, defined according to the
	% previous normal type (normal indices corresponding thus either to vertex
	% or face ones).
	%
	% (as tessellation induces the sharing of normals of the tessellating
	% triangles, normals should be indexed as well)
	%
	% Normals are optional, as they are mostly used for lighting, and mostly
	% useful if they are per-vertex (per-face normals can be deduced from the
	% vertices of that face)
	%
	normals = undefined :: maybe( [ vector3:unit_normal3() ] ),


	% How this mesh shall be rendered:
	rendering_info = none :: mesh_render:rendering_info(),

	% Any corresponding (OpenGL-level) rendering state:
	rendering_state :: maybe( mesh_render:rendering_state() ),


	% Bounding volume information:
	%
	% (can be for example a right-cuboid or a sphere)
	%
	bounding_volume :: maybe( bounding_volume:bounding_volume() ) } ).
