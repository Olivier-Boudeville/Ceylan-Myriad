# Ceylan-Myriad

![](/doc/myriad-title.png)

This repository corresponds to the part of the [Ceylan project](https://github.com/Olivier-Boudeville/Ceylan) gathering all Erlang-based, common developments (formerly known as the 'Common' layer).

Please refer to the [Myriad official documentation](http://myriad.esperide.org), otherwise to its [mirror](http://olivier-boudeville.github.io/Ceylan-Myriad/).

The 'master' branch is aimed to be the current stable version of this layer.
See the 'meta' branch for the upcoming major change in terms of the use of parse transforms.
