Ceylan-Myriad
=============

This repository corresponds to the part of the [Ceylan project](https://github.com/Olivier-Boudeville/Ceylan) gathering all Erlang-based, common developments (formerly known as the 'Common' layer).

The 'master' branch is aimed to be the current stable version of this layer.
See the 'future-meta' branch for the upcoming major change in terms of the use of parse transforms.
