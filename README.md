# Ceylan-Myriad

![Myriad logo](/doc/myriad-title.png)

This repository corresponds to the part of the [Ceylan project](https://github.com/Olivier-Boudeville/Ceylan) gathering all Erlang-based, common developments (formerly known as the 'Common' layer).

See also the [Myriad](http://myriad.esperide.org) official website.

The 'master' branch is aimed to be the current stable version of this layer.
See the 'meta' branch for the upcoming major change in terms of the use of parse transforms.
