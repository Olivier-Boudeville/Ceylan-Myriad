;; This is a more advanced configuration of Emacs regarding Erlang than
;; init-myriad-erlang-base.el.
;;
;; It was inspired from
;; https://github.com/erlang-ls/erlang_ls/blob/main/misc/dotemacs.

;; In a nutshell: quite a lot of these advanced features do not seem ready for
;; actual use, at least in our context; they lag, use huge CPU resources,
;; trigger numerous runtime errors ("LSP :: Method not implemented:
;; textDocument/documentSymbol" and all - origin being erlang_ls), report
;; essentially spurious errors (e.g. short of finding proper includes), lack
;; documentation, trigger unsollicited, problematic rebar3-based rebuilds,
;; freeze randomly and do not provide veritably interesting information. For
;; projects relying a lot on parse-transforms, they seem borderly unusable.
;;
;; So we finally selected only the relevant features, which are currently
;; auto-completion and display documentation of element at mouse cursor.



;; Require and enable the Yasnippet templating system:
;;
;; (however its interest could not be established; probably per-language
;; elements shall be added;
;; https://github.com/AndreaCrotti/yasnippet-snippets/tree/master/snippets/erlang-mode
;; does not seem that useful; this templating system is thus currently
;; deactivated)
;;
;;(use-package yasnippet :ensure (:wait t) :demand t)
;;(yas-global-mode t)

(setq lsp-enable-snippet nil)



;; company-mode section, for auto-completion popups.
;;
;; Can be deactivated with '(setq lsp-completion-provider :none)'.


;; Enable company by default, except for texts:

;; This form does not allow to set/unset easily company based on mode:
;;
;; (use-package company
;;   :after lsp-mode
;;   ;; Does not work: ':hook prog-mode' ('company' not found)
;;   ;;                ':hook (prog-mode . company-mode)'
;;   :bind (:map company-active-map
;;          ("<tab>" . company-complete-selection))
;;         (:map lsp-mode-map
;;          ("<tab>" . company-indent-or-complete-common))
;;   :custom
;;   (company-minimum-prefix-length 1)
;;   ;; Default is 0.2:
;;   (company-idle-delay 0.0))

(use-package company :ensure (:wait t) :demand t)

;;(global-company-mode 1)

;; Does not work: '(add-hook 'after-init-hook 'global-company-mode)'
(add-hook 'prog-mode-hook (company-mode 1))


;; Not working properly either ('No such file or directory, company-box'):
;;(use-package company-box
;; :hook (company-mode . company-box-mode))


;; Supposedly a tad better:
(use-package company-box :ensure (:wait t) :demand t)
(add-hook 'company-mode-hook 'company-box-mode)


;; lsp-ui: for fancy sideline, popup documentation, VScode-like peek UI, etc.
;;
;; With a dark theme, preferring a lightgrey background color for lsp-ui-doc
;; windows (and, for a light theme, a darkgrey background):
;;
(defface lsp-ui-doc-background
  '((((background light)) :background "#777777")
	(t :background "#dddddd"))
  "Background color of the documentation.
Only the `background' is used in this face."
  :group 'lsp-ui-doc)


;; Refer to https://emacs-lsp.github.io/lsp-mode/tutorials/how-to-turn-off/ for
;; a proper (general-purpose) lsp-mode configuration.


;; Diagnostics providers:

;; As flycheck (from init-myriad-fully-integrated.el)
;; should most probably be disabled when using lsp:
;;
;;(remove-hook 'erlang-mode-hook 'flycheck-mode)


;; Same applies to flymake, which reports many spurious issues in our use case
;; (e.g. due to parse-transforms).
;;
;; Yet this has no effect:
;;(remove-hook 'erlang-mode-hook 'flymake-mode)

;; Same:
;;(flymake-mode -1)

;; The way of silencing them all (fly*):
(setq lsp-diagnostics-provider :none)


;; LSP-related section.
;; See ~/Software/erlang_ls/misc/dotemacs for a configuration example.

;; Requires erlang_ls, typically obtained with:
;; cd ~/Software
;; git clone https://github.com/erlang-ls/
;; cd erlang_ls && make && mkdir bin && cd bin
;;   && ln -s ../_build/default/bin/erlang_ls
;; Then add ${HOME}/Software/erlang_ls/bin to your PATH.
;;
;; erlang_ls shall be regularly updated ('git pull && make all')

;;(use-package lsp-mode :ensure (:wait t) :demand t)

;; The extra text annotating our code source (e.g. "Used XXX times") is
;; displayed is a code lens (here "function-references"; see
;; https://erlang-ls.github.io/articles/tutorial-code-lenses/).
;;
;; We prefer having these "function-references" disabled, this can be set in
;; myriad/conf/erlang_ls.config, to which ~/.config/erlang_ls is supposed to
;; point (as a symbolic link).
;;
;; Another deactivation option is to use '(setq lsp-lens-enable nil)'.

;; Enable LSP for Erlang files.
;;
;; Was disabled due too many usability concerns; notably, type checking is
;; based on the sources rather than on the generated BEAM files, resulting in a
;; vast number of false positives.
;;
;; Now LSP is very selectively enabled, mostly to:
;;
;; - enjoy, when leaving the mouse cursor on an element, the display of a
;; contextual window describing its type, documentation, etc.
;;
;; - enable auto-completion based not only an Erlang/OTP modules, but also user
;; ones


;; More general, even too much (e.g. will attempt to apply to
;; makefile-gmake-mod, emacs-lisp-mode, etc. and will fail):
