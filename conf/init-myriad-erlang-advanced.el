;; This is a more advanced configuration of Emacs regarding Erlang than
;; init-myriad-erlang-base.el.
;;
;; Based on LSP.
;; For Erlang, used to rely on erlang_ls, now on elp.
;;
;; Refer to https://howtos.esperide.org/Erlang.html#using-emacs-for-erlang for
;; guidelines.


;; In a nutshell: possibly due to erlang_ls, quite a lot of these advanced
;; features did not seem ready for actual use, at least in our context; they
;; lag, use huge CPU resources, trigger numerous runtime errors ("LSP :: Method
;; not implemented: textDocument/documentSymbol" and all - origin being
;; erlang_ls), report essentially spurious errors (e.g. short of finding proper
;; includes), lack documentation, trigger unsollicited, problematic rebar3-based
;; rebuilds, freeze randomly and do not provide veritably interesting
;; information. For projects relying a lot on parse-transforms, they seem
;; borderly unusable.
;;
;; So we finally selected only the relevant features, which are currently
;; auto-completion and display documentation of element at mouse cursor.
;;
;; Note that this file covers advanded Erlang features, but most of them apply
;; to other languages as well.

;; YAML suport.

(add-hook 'yaml-mode-hook 'display-line-numbers-mode)

;; Not wanting clumsy attempt of spellchecking there:
(remove-hook 'yaml-mode-hook (lambda () (flyspell-mode 1)))


;; Surprisingly not built-in:
;;
;; With treesitter: yaml-ts-mode, yet requires an extra library for this
;; specific ts support.
;;
(use-package yaml-mode :ensure (:wait t) :demand t)

;; Useless: (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.yml\\'" . yaml-mode))



;; Require and enable the Yasnippet templating system:
;;
;; (however its interest could not be established; probably per-language
;; elements shall be added;
;; https://github.com/AndreaCrotti/yasnippet-snippets/tree/master/snippets/erlang-mode
;; does not seem that useful; this templating system is thus currently
;; deactivated)

;; LSP Package.
;;
;; Refer to https://emacs-lsp.github.io/lsp-mode/tutorials/how-to-turn-off/ for
;; a proper (general-purpose) lsp-mode configuration.


;; Diagnostics providers:

;; As flycheck (from init-myriad-fully-integrated.el)
;; should most probably be disabled when using lsp:
;;
;;(remove-hook 'erlang-mode-hook 'flycheck-mode)


;; Same applies to flymake, which reports many spurious issues in our use case
;; (e.g. due to parse-transforms).
;;
;; Yet this has no effect:
;;(remove-hook 'erlang-mode-hook 'flymake-mode)

;; Same:
;;(flymake-mode -1)

;; The way of silencing them all (fly*):
;;(setq lsp-diagnostics-provider :none)



(use-package lsp-mode

  ;; Enable LSP automatically for Erlang files:
  ;;:hook ((erlang-mode . lsp)) ;; Not working properly
  (add-hook 'erlang-mode-hook #'lsp)

;; The extra text annotating our code source (e.g. "Used XXX times") is
;; displayed is a code lens (here "function-references"; see

;;
;; We prefer having these "function-references" disabled, this can be set in
;; myriad/conf/erlang_ls.config, to which ~/.config/erlang_ls is supposed to
;; point (as a symbolic link).
;;
;; Another deactivation option is to use '(setq lsp-lens-enable nil)'.



;; Enable LSP for Erlang files.
;;
;; Was disabled due too many usability concerns; notably, type checking is
;; based on the sources rather than on the generated BEAM files, resulting in a
;; vast number of false positives.
;;
;; Now LSP is very selectively enabled, mostly to:
;;
;; - enjoy, when leaving the mouse cursor on an element, the display of a
;; contextual window describing its type, documentation, etc.
;;
;; - enable auto-completion based not only an Erlang/OTP modules, but also user
;; ones


;; More general, even too much (e.g. will attempt to apply to
;; makefile-gmake-mod, emacs-lisp-mode, etc. and will fail):
