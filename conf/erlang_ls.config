# Path to the OTP installation.
#
# $HOME would probably not be translated, however this path seems to be
# automatically determined, supposedly based on the one of 'erl' or other
# element:
#
#otp_path: "$HOME/Software/Erlang/Erlang-current-install/lib/erlang"

# Note: these tools operate on sources, not on BEAM files.
