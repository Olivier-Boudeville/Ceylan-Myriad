;; terms.



;; Description:

;; In the Acme editor, right-clicking on a word finds the next occurrence
;; of that word, and moves the mouse to the new occurrence. In this way,
;; you can search through all occurrences of a word by repeatedly
;; right-clicking. This file gives Emacs the same power.
;;
;; To use, add (require 'acme-search) to your .emacs. I bind
;; `acme-search-forward' to mouse-3, and `acme-search-backward' to
;; shift-mouse-3, like so:

;; (global-set-key [(mouse-3)] 'acme-search-forward)
;; (global-set-key [(shift mouse-3)] 'acme-search-backward)
