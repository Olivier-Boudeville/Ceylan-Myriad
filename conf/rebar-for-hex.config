% This is a (manually crafted) configuration file of rebar3 *in the context of
% an hex package* (ex: in this case only src/ is package, and none of the root
% GNUmake* files), so that Ceylan-Myriad can better integrate in the current OTP
% ecosystem, despite its (more complex) build based on GNU make.


% Base layout was obtained thanks to: 'rebar3 new lib myriad', as Myriad is a
% library OTP application (without supervision trees).

% To be run from the library root as 'rebar3 compile' or 'rebar3 release'.
